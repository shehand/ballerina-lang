# + keyStore - Configurations associated with KeyStore.

# + protocol - Configurations related to SSL/TLS protocol and version to be used.
# + sslProvider - The name of the security provider used for SSL connections. Default value is the default security
#               provider of the JVM.
# + sslKeyPassword - The password of the private key in the key store file. This is optional for client.
# + sslCipherSuites - A list of cipher suites. This is a named combination of authentication, encryption, MAC and key
#               exchange algorithm used to negotiate the security settings for a network connection using TLS or SSL
#               network protocol. By default all the available cipher suites are supported.

#               certificate.
# + sslSecureRandomImplementation - The SecureRandom PRNG implementation to use for SSL cryptography operations.
