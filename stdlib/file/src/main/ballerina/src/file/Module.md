## Module Overview

This module contains functions to perform file system based operations such as create, delete, rename the
file/directory, and retrieve metadata of the file.

For an example on the usage of the operations, see the [File Example](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/by-example/file.html).

## Directory Listener 

The `Directory Listener` is used to listen to a directory in the local file system. It notifies when new files are created in the directory or when the existing files are deleted or modified.

For an example on the usage of the operations, see the [Directory Listener Example](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/by-example/directory-listener.html).
