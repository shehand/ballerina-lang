# Returns a clone of `v`.
# A clone is a deep copy that does not copy immutable subtrees.

#
# When `v` is a structural value, the inherent type of the value to be constructed
# comes from `t`. When `t` is a union, it must be possible to determine which
# member of the union to use for the inherent type by following the same rules
# that are used by list constructor expressions and mapping constructor expressions
# with the contextually expected type. If not, then an error is returned.
# The `constructFrom` operation is recursively applied to each member of `v` using
# the type descriptor that the inherent type requires for that member.
#
# Like the Clone abstract operation, this does a deep copy, but differs in
# the following respects:
# - the inherent type of any structural values constructed comes from the specified
#   type descriptor rather than the value being constructed
# - the read-only bit of values and fields comes from the specified type descriptor
# - the graph structure of `v` is not preserved; the result will always be a tree;
#   an error will be returned if `v` has cycles
# - immutable structural values are copied rather being returned as is; all
#   structural values in the result will be mutable, except for error values
#   (which are always immutable)
# - numeric values can be converted using the NumericConvert abstract operation
# - if a record type descriptor specifies default values, these will be used
#   to supply any missing members
