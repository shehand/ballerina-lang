DESCRIPTION
       Ballerina is a statically typed, concurrent programming language, focusing on network interaction and structured
       data. It is intended to be the core of a language-centric middleware platform. It has all the general-purpose
       functionality expected of a modern programming language, but it also has several unusual aspects that make it
       particularly suitable for its intended purpose.
