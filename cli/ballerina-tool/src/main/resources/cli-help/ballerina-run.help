NAME
       ballerina-run - Build and execute a Ballerina program

SYNOPSIS
       ballerina run [<options>] <ballerina-file-path> | <module-name>
                        | <executable-jar> [<config properties>] [--] [<arguments>]


DESCRIPTION
       Run builds and executes the given .bal file, module, or program.

       If a Ballerina source file (.bal file) or a module is given, the run
       command builds and runs it. Compilation is done internally and the
       executable will not be created.

       You may use the 'ballerina build' command to compile a source and
       provide the generated binary file (.jar file) to the run command.
       The binary runs much faster than a source file, because running a source
       file requires a compilation phase.

       You must have either a public 'main' function or a service(s) or both
       in order to run a program or a module.

       When both a 'main' function and a service(s) are present, run executes
       the 'main' function first and then starts the services.


OPTIONS
       --offline
           When building a module, the remote repository (Ballerina Central) is
           always checked for latest artifacts of the dependencies. If the
           '--offline' option is specified, this remote check is not done and
           the local artifacts will be used instead.

       --sourceroot <path>
           Provide the path to be taken as the root of the source.
           The source will be looked up relative to the given source root
           path.

       --experimental
           Enable experimental language features.

       --debug
           Run in remote debugging mode.

       --observability-included
           Package observability in the executable when run is used
           with a source file or a module.

CONFIG PROPERTIES
       (--key=value)...
           Set the Ballerina environment parameters as key/value pairs.
           If multiple parameters need to be provided, each parameter
           has to be prefixed with '--'. Details of the environment parameters
           supported by the Ballerina standard library modules are specified
           in the relevant API documentation.

ARGUMENTS
       --
           The argument '--' signals the end of Ballerina environment
           parameters. Any and all arguments following '--' are treated as
           arguments to the program even if they start with '--'.

       args...
           The list of command line arguments for the Ballerina program
           being run. The semantics of these arguments are defined by
           the program design.


DEFAULT BEHAVIOR
       Run command runs the 'main' function in the given program or module, if present.
       Then looks for a service, and starts the relevant listeners if services
       are present. If no 'main' function or service is present, the run
       command will fail.


EXAMPLES
       Run the 'main' function and/or services in the hello .bal file.
          $ ballerina run hello.bal

       Run the 'main' function and/or services in the hello executable jar.
          $ ballerina run hello.jar

       Run the 'main' function and/or services in the hello module.
          $ ballerina run hello

       Run the 'main' function in the math module with three program args:
       add, 10 and 5. If the second and third parameters of the 'main'
       function are of types int and int, the second and third arguments
       would be passed as integer values 10 and 5.
          $ ballerina run math add 10 5
