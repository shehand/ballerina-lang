NAME
       ballerina-test - Run module tests

SYNOPSIS
       ballerina test [<options>] <module-name> [<config properties>]
       ballerina test -a | --all [<options>] [--] [<config properties>]
       ballerina test <balfile> [<config properties>]


DESCRIPTION
       Test compiles and executes Ballerina test sources and print a summary of
       test results. You can execute tests in a module,
       or an entire Ballerina project.
    
       Use 'ballerina test <module-name>' to execute tests in the
       specified module, or '-a' or '-all' to execute tests in all modules.

       Use 'ballerina test <balfile>' to execute the given Ballerina test file.
              Note that testing single bal files will not work within a Ballerina project.
              Also, imports from other modules will not work for file executions.
              File path can be relative or absolute.


OPTIONS
       --offline
           When building a module, the remote repository (Ballerina Central) is
           always checked for latest artifacts of the dependencies. If the
           '--offline' option is specified, this remote check is not done and
           the local artifacts will be used instead.

       --list-groups
           Lists the test groups available in the test files. Groups are
           tags that are added to test functions. They are used to
           control the execution of test functions by specifying a
           group or a set of groups that need to be executed in a test
           run. A test function can be grouped using the 'groups' parameter within the
           '@test:Config' annotation.

       --groups <test_group, ...>
           Specifies the test groups to be executed. Groups are tags that are
           added to test functions. They are used to control the
           execution of test functions by specifying a group or a set of
           groups that need to be executed in a test run. A test
           function can be grouped using the 'groups' parameter within the
           '@test:Config' annotation.

       --disable-groups <test_group, ...>
           Specifies the test groups to be excluded. Groups are tags that are
           added to test functions. They are used to control the
           execution of test functions by specifying a group or a set of
           groups that need to be executed in a test run. A test
           function can be grouped using the 'groups' parameter within the
           '@test:Config' annotation.

       --tests <test_function_name, ...>
            Specifies the test functions to be executed. A specific set of
            test functions can be executed using this command.

       --rerun-failed
            Executes only the previously failed test cases for the specified
            module.

       --sourceroot <path>
           Location of the remote project root with source files. All
           executions will be relative to the path provided for
           sourceroot.

       --code-coverage
           Enables code coverage. This will analyze the line coverage of
           source .bal files in the Ballerina project and add a section
           to the testerina report with code coverage details.
           This feature is not supported with single file executions.

       --test-report
           Generates an HTML report containing test results. Defaults to 'true'
           if code coverage is enabled.

       --experimental
           Enable experimental language features.

       --skip-lock
           Build/Compile offline without downloading dependencies.

       --debug
           Run tests in remote debugging mode.

       --observability-included
           Package observability in the executable.

CONFIG PROPERTIES
       (--key=value)...
           Set the Ballerina environment parameters as key/value pairs.
           If multiple parameters need to be provided, each parameter
           has to be prefixed with '--'. Details of the environment parameters
           supported by the Ballerina standard library modules are specified
           in the relevant API documentation.


EXAMPLES
        Run all tests in the current project.
           $ ballerina test --all

        Run tests in math module.
           $ ballerina test math

        List all test groups in math module.
           $ ballerina test --list-groups math
